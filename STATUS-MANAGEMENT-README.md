# Task Status Management Enhancement

This enhancement adds a flexible, scope-aware task status management system to the Warp Agent System, following the requirements outlined in the PRD.

## New Files

### Schema
- `/src/schema/status-management-schema.graphql`: GraphQL schema for status entities
- `/src/types/generated/status-management-schema.ts`: TypeScript schema definitions

### Services
- `/src/services/status-management-service.ts`: Core service for status operations
- `/src/services/workflow-status-service.ts`: Service for workflow-status integration

### Agents
- `/src/agents/orchestrator-agent.ts`: Enhanced orchestrator implementation

### Utilities
- `/src/scripts/populate-status-entities.ts`: Scripts to populate status entities
- `/src/tests/status-management-test.js`: Test script for validation

## Key Features

1. **Status as First-Class Entities**: Status definitions stored as entities in the CKG
2. **Scope-Aware Inheritance**: Status definitions can be defined at different scope levels (User > Project > Team > Org > Default)
3. **Workflow Integration**: Workflows reference status entities for transitions
4. **Selective UI Exposure**: Architecture supports full customization while UI exposes appropriate controls by role

## How It Works

1. Status entities are defined in the CKG with scope and transition rules
2. Workflows reference these status entities for step requirements and results
3. The Orchestrator uses status rules during task decomposition and assignment
4. Services provide APIs for resolving, validating, and updating statuses

## Testing

Run the status management test script to validate the implementation:

```bash
node dist/tests/status-management-test.js
```

The test script will:
1. Create default and project-specific statuses
2. Test scope resolution
3. Test task status assignment and transitions
4. Verify Orchestrator integration

## Next Steps

1. Create UI components for status visualization
2. Implement admin interfaces for status configuration
3. Add user permission controls for status management
4. Develop dashboard views based on status aggregation
