# Activity Tracker Integration Status

## Overview

This document summarizes the current status of the Activity Tracker integration with the CKG.

## Implementation Status

- **Schema Integration**: ✅ Schema files are ready, but schema initialization has issues
- **TypeScript Definitions**: ✅ Type definitions and interfaces are implemented
- **Import Path Updates**: ✅ Updated import paths to use .js extensions for ESM compatibility
- **Agent Integration**: ✅ Created AgentActivityLogger for agent integration
- **CLI Tools**: ✅ Updated CLI tools for the CKG-based activity tracking
- **Documentation**: ✅ Created comprehensive documentation for integration and usage

## Current Issues

1. **TypeScript Errors in activity-tracker-ckg.ts**:
   - The CKG utility functions have different interface expectations
   - The parameters for queryCkg and updateCkg need to be updated
   - Type casting is needed for specialized activity types

2. **ESM Module Issues**:
   - Some files are still using CommonJS patterns (require vs import)
   - Module resolution fails for some imports

3. **Schema Initialization Errors**:
   - The schema initialization script cannot find required files
   - Zod schema generation fails

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Interface Mismatches**:
   - Update the queryCkg and updateCkg calls to match the current interface
   - Add proper type assertions for activity specializations

2. **Fix ESM Compatibility**:
   - Ensure all files use ESM import/export syntax
   - Update module resolution in tsconfig.json

3. **Manual Schema Integration**:
   - Manually add the activity schema to the main schema
   - Run schema initialization from the CLI

4. **Testing**:
   - Create a simple test harness that doesn't depend on the full integration
   - Test individual components in isolation

## Workaround for Testing

Until the TypeScript errors are fixed, the following approach can be used for testing:

1. Create a simple script that manually creates activity records in the CKG
2. Use direct database queries to verify the data
3. Create a JavaScript version of the agent integration that avoids TypeScript errors

## Conclusion

The Activity Tracker Integration is structurally complete but has TypeScript and module compatibility issues that need to be resolved. The design is sound and follows the scoped inheritance pattern described in the PRD, but implementation details need to be fixed for full functionality.
