# Activity Tracker Integration Status

## Overview

This document summarizes the current status of the Activity Tracker integration with the CKG.

## Implementation Status

- **Schema Integration**: ✅ Schema files are ready, but schema initialization has issues
- **TypeScript Definitions**: ✅ Type definitions and interfaces are implemented
- **Import Path Updates**: ✅ Updated import paths to use .js extensions for ESM compatibility
- **Agent Integration**: ✅ Created AgentActivityLogger for agent integration
- **CLI Tools**: ✅ Updated CLI tools for the CKG-based activity tracking
- **Documentation**: ✅ Created comprehensive documentation for integration and usage

## Current Issues

1. **TypeScript Errors in activity-tracker-ckg.ts**:
   - The CKG utility functions have different interface expectations
   - The parameters for queryCkg and updateCkg need to be updated
   - Type casting is needed for specialized activity types

2. **ESM Module Issues**:
   - Some files are still using CommonJS patterns (require vs import)
   - Module resolution fails for some imports

3. **Schema Initialization Errors**:
   - The schema initialization script cannot find required files
   - Zod schema generation fails

## Next Steps

1. **Use Simplified Activity Tracker**:
   - We've created a simplified version of the activity tracker that uses an adapter to bridge the interface gap
   - This simplified version can be used while we work on fixing the main implementation
   - Run the simplified tests to verify functionality: `./test-activity-simplified.sh`

2. **Manual Schema Integration**:
   - We've created a manual schema integration script: `./manual-schema-integration.sh`
   - This script will manually add the activity schema to the main schema
   - Run the script and choose to initialize the schema when prompted

3. **Fix Main Implementation**:
   - Apply the adapter pattern to the main activity-tracker-ckg.ts file
   - Update the specialized activity types to use proper type assertions
   - Fix the remaining ESM compatibility issues

4. **Full Integration Testing**:
   - Once the main implementation is fixed, run the full integration tests
   - Test agent integration using the AgentActivityLogger

## Implemented Workarounds

We've implemented the following workarounds to enable testing while we fix the main implementation:

1. **CKG Adapter (ckg-adapter.ts)**:
   - Provides compatible interfaces to the CKG functions
   - Converts the parameters to the format expected by the CKG
   - Converts the result to the format expected by the Activity Tracker

2. **Simplified Activity Tracker (activity-tracker-simplified.ts)**:
   - Uses the CKG adapter to bridge the interface gap
   - Implements a subset of the functionality for basic testing
   - Includes logActivity, logComment, and getTaskTimeline methods

3. **Simplified Test Harness (activity-simplified-test.ts)**:
   - Tests the simplified activity tracker
   - Logs test comments and verifies task timeline
   - Run with `./test-activity-simplified.sh`

4. **Manual Schema Integration (manual-schema-integration.sh)**:
   - Manually appends the activity schema to the main schema
   - Creates a backup of the main schema
   - Optionally runs schema initialization

## Conclusion

The Activity Tracker Integration is structurally complete but has TypeScript and module compatibility issues that need to be resolved. The design is sound and follows the scoped inheritance pattern described in the PRD, but implementation details need to be fixed for full functionality.
