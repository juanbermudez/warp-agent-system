# Warp MVP UI Implementation - Current Progress

## Status: Initial Setup

The UI implementation plan, as detailed in `Warp-MVP-UI-plan.md`, has been thoroughly reviewed. This document outlines the approach for building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) user interface for the Warp system.

A new branch has been created for this purpose: `warp-mvp-ui-implementation`. All UI development work will be completed within this branch to maintain clear separation and organization.

## Phase 1: Electron App UI - Project Initialization & Template Copy

**Tasks Completed:**

-   [x] Established UI directory: Created `src/renderer`

-   [x] Copied dashboard template: Copied `ui-examples/dashboard-template-main` into `src/renderer`.

-   [x] Adapted Vite configuration: Modified `vite.config.ts` to work in Electron environment.

-   [x] Configured Template Dependencies: Reviewed and installed dependencies.

-   [x] Configured Electron Integration: Created `src/index.ts` to load the Vite renderer.

## Phase 2: Dashboard Template Analysis & Adaptation

**Tasks Completed:**

-   [x] Created `tremor-component-inventory.md`: Inventory created with the components and their files

-   [x] Created `MainLayout`: Created `src/renderer/layouts/MainLayout.tsx` for the main layout and implemented the base navigation using the existing sidebar.

-   [x] Created `TaskTable`: Created `src/renderer/components/ui/table/TaskTable.tsx` and added a base implementation using Tremor components.

-   [ ] Skipped `Task 2.4: Adapt Authentication from Login 4 Block`: The Login 4 example was not found in the ui-examples folder; authentication is not a priority for this MVP, so this task is being skipped for now.

Phase 2 is now complete. 


## Phase 3: Views Implementation (Adapting Template Pages)

**Tasks Completed:**

- [x] Created `DashboardView`: Created `src/renderer/views/dashboard/DashboardView.tsx` for the main dashboard and added base cards.

- [x] Created `TaskListView`: Created `src/renderer/views/dashboard/TaskListView.tsx` and added base structure using Tremor Tabs and `TaskTable` component.

- [x] Created `TaskDetailDrawer`: Created `src/renderer/components/ui/drawers/TaskDetailDrawer.tsx` to show the task details when selecting a task.

Phase 3 is now complete.

## Phase 4: Landing Page Setup (Website Template)

**Tasks Completed:**

- [x] Created `website` directory: Created `website` directory at the root level.
- [x] Copied template: Copied `ui-examples/website-template` into the `website` directory.


- [x] Installed dependencies: Ran `npm install` in the `website` directory to install the website dependencies.

- [x] Website adapted: Modified the website home page (`index.tsx`) to be about Dopabase.


Phase 4 is now complete.


## Phase 5: Data Integration via Electron IPC

**Tasks Completed:**

- [x] Created `preload.ts`: Created `src/preload.ts` and defined the IPC communication channels.
