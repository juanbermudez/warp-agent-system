# Warp Agent System: Project Overview

## Vision
Warp aims to accelerate high-quality software development by integrating AI deeply into structured, proven workflows, leveraging precise context from a unified knowledge base (CKG/Memory Bank) and ensuring human oversight at critical junctures.

## Goals
- Establish a functional, locally running agent system capable of executing software development tasks
- Validate the feasibility and coordination logic of the multi-agent system on sample tasks
- Provide a foundation for the full Warp application

## Scope

### In Scope
- Local setup and configuration of the agent system logic
- CKG schema and population (from code/docs/context files)
- Conceptual tool interfaces
- HITL triggering mechanisms
- Basic command execution capabilities
- Dynamic resource management (conceptual logic)

### Out of Scope
- Building the interactive Electron UI
- Advanced CKG reasoning/inference
- Advanced error handling
- Complex GUI tool integrations
- Sophisticated security sandboxing beyond basic checks

## Key Features
- Multi-agent architecture (Orchestrator, PL, DE, FE, BE, QA)
- Unified knowledge via local CKG database
- Task-driven workflow with JIT decomposition
- Dependency analysis enabling potential parallelism
- HITL reviews at critical checkpoints
- Shell command execution (with approval)
